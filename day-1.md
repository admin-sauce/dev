### 🤕 The Struggles

- Tried creating a file?  
  ➤ `touch` slapped me with a `"Permission denied"`.
  
- Tried listing users?  
  ➤ `"Invalid user"` laughed in my face.
  
- Tried changing permissions?  
  ➤ `"Operation not permitted"` shut me down cold.

---

### 💡 What I Learned

- ✔️ How to **list users** like a pro.
- ✔️ Created a **new user** without breaking the system.
- ✔️ Understood **permissions**:
  - `rwx` — Read, Write, Execute
  - `755` — Owner has all rights, others can read & execute
  - `--x--x--x` — Only execute for everyone
- ✔️ Faced **root** like a boss using `sudo`.
- ✔️ Finally made that **cursed file executable**.

### 🔥 Final Thought

Every `"Permission denied"` wasn’t just an error.  
It was a test of patience, persistence, and power.  
Linux didn’t just teach me terminal commands —  
it taught me to **fight back**.
